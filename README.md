## 项目简介

TODO

<!---
Peatio is a free and open-source crypto currency exchange implementation with the Rails framework. Peatio.tech is a fork of Peatio designed for micro-services architecture. We have simplified the code in order to use only Peatio API with external frontend and server components.

To build your own exchange you should now run Peatio as a backend instead of forking the repository, and extend it using other microservices such as Barong.
